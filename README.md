Working on interfaces like GameObjects implementing isSolid/isMoving/isDanger ,
to standardize objects for collision detection

* to do *
$  1. Get Printing again 
X  2. Add collision/hit detection
X  3. Work on movement (keyPressed for longer = higher jump, speed ramp over time, etc)
X  4. Game states like building > ready > running > winCondition
